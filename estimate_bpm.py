        Before we get into computing the window bpm, let's figure out exactly what the DWT is.
        Those familiar with signal processing will know the Fourier Transform, which decomposes a
        signal into its constituents. On a high level, the DWT does a similar decomposition, but only
        into high-frequency and low-frequency components, while maintaining when these frequencies occur.
        These are stored in the detail coefficients (dC) and approximation coefficients (aC) respectively.
        By performing cascading DWTs on the approximation coefficients, we can recover finer frequency resolution,
        which is what we want for a good frequency decomposition:
